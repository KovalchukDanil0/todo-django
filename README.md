# Django Todo App

**ToDo WebSite** is written with modern [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com) and uses Python backend, as for frontend it uses [Jinja template](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) as well with [Scss](https://sass-lang.com) support to improve development process. For more complex logic it might needed .js/.ts client logic.

## Run

`python -m pip install Django` for Linux/MacOs users  
`py -m pip install Django` for Windows users

after Django successfully installed run `python manage.py runserver`
